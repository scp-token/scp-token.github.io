## 1. Project Overview

SCP Token (symbol: SCP) is a standard blockchain token created as a technical and community experiment.

The purpose of the project is to:

* Explore decentralized token deployment
* Practice open-source smart contract development
* Experiment with community-driven fictional digital assets
* Learn blockchain infrastructure deployment and verification

This project does **not** represent investment advice, financial instruments, or securities. It is an experimental token with no intrinsic value or guaranteed utility.

## 3. Design Philosophy

SCP Token is structured around three guiding principles:

### 1. Transparency

All token information is publicly accessible on-chain.

### 2. Simplicity

No complex mechanisms, no hidden minting logic, no dynamic supply models.

### 3. Educational Purpose

This project serves as a learning milestone in smart contract deployment, token standard implementation, and decentralized publishing.

## 4. Intended Use

SCP Token currently has no mandatory utility. Possible community-driven directions may include:

* Digital collectibles
* Community tipping token
* Fictional lore participation rewards
* Experimental governance simulation
* Developer learning demonstrations

Future developments depend entirely on voluntary community contribution.
