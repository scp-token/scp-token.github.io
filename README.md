## 1. Project summary
SCP is a fan-inspired BEP-20 token created by an independent developer community. The token is inspired by the SCP universe as a creative theme and is **not affiliated with or endorsed by** the 1. Portions of source inspiration from the SCP Wiki are licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (CC BY-SA 3.0)** — see the Licensing section below.

This project focuses on community building, transparent tokenomics, and honest, long-term development rather than speculative manipulation.

## 3. Tokenomics (initial proposal)
Total supply: **17,309,600 SCP**

| Allocation | % | Amount (SCP) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Initial Liquidity (PancakeSwap) | 40% | 6,923,840 | Strongly recommend LP lock |
| Community / Rewards / Airdrop | 20% | 3,461,920 | Farming, early supporters |
| Treasury / Ecosystem (incl. private sale) | 15% | 2,596,440 | Marketing, partnerships, reserve |
| Team (vested) | 10% | 1,730,960 | 24-month linear vesting, 6-month cliff |
| Marketing / Partnerships | 10% | 1,730,960 | Campaigns, KOLs, bounties |
| Advisors / Bounties | 5% | 865,480 | Short-term incentives |

**Notes:** a portion (e.g. 5% = 865,480) from Treasury can be used for a private sale / seed round to raise initial project funds (with KYC/agreements).

## 4. Roadmap (high level)
- **Phase 0 — Launch & Verify (done):** Contract deployed and verified on 4.  
- **Phase 1 — Liquidity & Safety (weeks 1–2):** Add SCP/BNB liquidity on 5, transfer ownership to multisig (6), lock LP via reputable lock service.  
- **Phase 2 — Community & Listings (month 1–3):** Launch Telegram/Discord, publish one-pager & GitHub code, submit to CoinGecko / CoinMarketCap, apply for token lists.  
- **Phase 3 — Incentives & Utility (month 3–6):** Community rewards, staking/pools, strategic partnerships.  
- **Phase 4 — Ongoing:** Roadmap updates, audits if budget allows, explore cross-chain options.

## 5. Security & best practices
- **Contract:** Verified source code on 7.  
- **Ownership:** Project will transfer owner to a multisig (8) and publicly announce the multisig address.  
- **LP Lock:** All initial LP tokens will be locked using a reputable lock service (e.g. Team.Finance / Unicrypt) and a lock proof link will be published.  
- **Audits:** A formal third-party audit is recommended prior to larger listings; at minimum, a community/code review will be published.  
- **Transparency:** Monthly treasury and expense reports will be published (on request or via GitHub).

## 6. How to buy / add token to wallet
1. Add token to MetaMask / Trust Wallet using contract address above, decimals = 18.  
2. Swap on 9 using SCP/BNB pair once liquidity is provided.  
3. Recommended slippage: 0.5%–2% (for standard token). If you experience failed transactions, increase slippage slightly.
